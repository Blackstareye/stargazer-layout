# Description

Stargazer Layout is a hugo theme module that uses [beer
css](https://www.beercss.com/) for styling and supports `node_modules`
and `importmaps`. It offers features like minification, fingerprinting,
and custom JS/CSS integration.

It uses `beercss` as default styling. It also enables node_modules and
importmaps. Also custom js and css is available.

This is the theme module that contains all layout specific files and
functions. It can be used as a standalone or as a bundle with Stargazer
